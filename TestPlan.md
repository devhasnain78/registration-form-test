   - Confirm that data is successfully submitted to the server upon correct form completion.
   - Ensure the user experience is smooth and intuitive.

3. **Scope**

   - Functional testing of all input fields and the submit button.
   - Validation of input constraints (e.g., password length, email format).
   - Verification of error messages.
